# TODO App with Local Storage


A simple TODO app built with React that allows users to manage tasks and store them in local storage. The app ensures that even after reloading the page, the existing tasks are not deleted.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title and optional description.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks individually or all completed tasks at once.
- Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

 2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install vite
    npm install
3. **Start the development server**

    ```bash
    npm tun dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

## Usage
  Add a new task by entering a title and, if desired, a description and clicking the "Add Task" button.
  To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task title.
  To delete a single task, click the delete button (trash icon) next to the task.
  To Edit the task u already entered 'Edit' button will help u in that.

## Technologies Used
  React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  Local Storage API: To store tasks in the browser's local storage.
